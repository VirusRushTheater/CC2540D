# CC2540D (A C++ Open API to use the CC2540 USB dongle)

I needed some automatic functionality for the dongle, to test an application I'm developing for the CC2540, so I've made this.

## Requirements

The libraries this project uses are LibUSB and Pthreads. C++98 is used to compile.

Only tested on Linux Mint (Kernel 3.13.0-37). If you can test it on Windows, I'd be grateful to have feedback.
