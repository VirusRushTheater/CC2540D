# CC2540D (A C++ Open API to use the CC2540 USB dongle)

I needed some automatic functionality for the dongle, to test an application I'm developing for the CC2540, so I've made this.

## Requirements

The libraries this project uses are LibUSB and Pthreads. C++98 is used to compile.

Only tested on Linux Mint (Kernel 3.13.0-37). If you can test it on Windows, I'd be grateful to have feedback. You can use QtCreator to edit and debug this project (QtCreator has a really good debugger), but you can just compile it using CMake if you don't have intentions to edit it.
